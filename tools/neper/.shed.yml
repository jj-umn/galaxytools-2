description: Neper tessellation, meshing, and visualization
long_description: |
  Methods such as far-field 3DXRD or Laue diffraction provides incomplete information
  on a grain structure, such as the grains centroids (centers of mass) and volumes.
  Neper can generate the optimal tessellation (made of convex cells) that corresponds
  to such a data set.
  The tessellation can be described as a raster tessellation (for FFT simulations)
  or can be meshed (for FEM simulations).
